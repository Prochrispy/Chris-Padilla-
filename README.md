kickstarter Analysis 
July 26, 2020 

## Project Overview 
  The importance of this project is to help Louise comprehend the success of the campaigns of different plays. To illustrate the success or failure of the campaigns, a pivot table and chart were used to visualize in which month of the year were plays most succesful and which ones failed the most. In adittional to the pivot table, an excel worksheet had been created to calculate the percentage of each play campaign had successfully met its funding goal at the time of their launch date. To help understand the calculations, a line graph was designed to illustrate the percentgae of success and failure of campaigns within certain funding ranges. 

## Analysis and Challenges 
### Pivot Table 
  From all of the data of the kickstarter campaign worksheet. I was capable of creating a pivot table that depicts which months out of the year, theaters had seen its most success and failures. The tables concludes that during the months of June and July were the most successful for the theaters. With 101 successful plays during the month of June and 109 successful plays in July. However, the month of July had been the second highest number of failed plays. As August became the month with highest number of failed plays. To better visualize the finds of the pivot table, I created a line graph that correlates the number of successful and failed play campaigns during each month.

#### Pivot Challenges 
  The most difficult part of this analysis was creating the pivot table. I had ensure that the I choose the most appropriate categories from the dataset to create the pivot table and then filtering the table to show the data that I wanted. To get the exact data I wanted from my pivot table, I played around with the filters until, I finally managed to display the total number of plays launched at each particular month and how many were successful, failed, and canceled. 
### Funding Goals 
  I created a seperated excel worksheet that demostrated the average and percentage of the most successful, failed and canceled funded goals within a certain range. My finding concluded that, funding goals ranging between 1,000 to 4,999 were far more successful than any other range. With a successful rate of 71%. However, this particular range had the highest number of failures but did not have the highest percentage of failure. The highest percentage of failure had been within the 45,000 to 49,9999 range. Where only one play had a goal in between this range and the play failed to reach its goal. To better understand my findings, I created a line graph that depicts the percentage of the rate of successful and failure for each range.

#### Funding Goals Challenges 
  The calculatation of the average number of success, failed, canceled outcome for each goal range was the hardest part. I had to make sure that the furmula that I used to obtain my averages had the correct variables to get the most accurate results. Even though, most of the time I had been inputing each variable one by one. I find a quicker and easier way to obtain my data. Which was to freeze each variables and then copy it over to each column and only having to change criteria of success, failed and canceled. 

##Results  
  In conculsion the summer months of June and July are the best months to launch. However there is a higher rate of failure as well. Also having a lower funding goal is more likely to be successful than a higher goal. Though, the dataset had vaules that depicted in different currencies, which one can question if the values under the goal column were accurately converted in dollars. I would recommended that charts showing the success between different countries or having a graph that demostrates the rate sucess within subcategories
